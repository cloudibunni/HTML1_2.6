            <td> The purple flowers of the <i style="color: darkblue;"><strong>Texas Mountain Laurel</strong></i> are hard to miss in March and April. While this is really a small ornamental tree, it can be grown as a large evergreen shrub. These multi-trunked plants are known to be slow growers and thrive in rocky, poor soil.</td>
			
<td>The <i style="color: red;"><strong>Indian blanket</strong></i> flower, scientifically known as Gaillardia pulchella, is a vibrant and colorful wildflower native to North America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange petals with yellow tips, which resemble the vibrant patterns seen on traditional Native American blankets, hence its name. </td>
			<td> <i style="color: orange;"> <strong> Lantana</strong></i> is a colorful and popular flowering plant known for its clusters of small, tubular-shaped flowers. These flowers typically bloom in shades of red, orange, yellow, pink, or purple, often with a mix of colors in a single cluster. <i style="color: orange;"><strong>Lantanas</strong></i> are admired for their vibrant and attractive appearance, making them a favorite choice in gardens and landscapes.</td>
			<td>The <i style="color: rebeccapurple;"><strong>Texas Sage</strong></i>, scientifically known as Leucophyllum frutescens, is a drought-tolerant shrub native to Texas and other southwestern regions of the United States. It is known for its silvery-gray foliage and its stunning purple, pink, or blue-violet flowers that bloom after rainfall. These flowers are tubular in shape and are often referred to as "barometer bush" due to their tendency to bloom after a rain shower.</td>
